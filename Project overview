Tech Stack Used:
HTML – For creating the structure of the web app

CSS – For styling and making the UI responsive and visually appealing

JavaScript – For handling user interaction and API integration

How It Works:
User enters a city name in the input box.

On clicking "Search", JavaScript sends a fetch request to a public weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

The response is parsed, and the relevant weather data is extracted.

The app dynamically updates the DOM to display the weather information.

Example Tools & APIs Used:
OpenWeatherMap API

fetch() for making API calls

Basic DOM manipulation with JavaScript
